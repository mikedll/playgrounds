  2allocating and initialize objects

    from class methods:
    
    newInstance = [[self alloc] init] // inheritance-friendly
    fail: self = [[ClassName alloc] init]

    init: it can return nil, which is why

    dangerous (recall and talk about why)
      a = A alloc
      a init
      a doSomething

  3protocols

    for when you want to declare an interface that CLIENTs
    must use. honestly I don't see the point when you can just
    declare your own interface and be done with it...lots of cerimony
    for nothing.



    // Formal protocol
    @protocol MyProtocol
      -(void) req
    @optional
      -(void) optional
    @required
      -(void) required again
    @end

    // Informal protocol declared as a category. appears to be the only
    // way to declare such a protocol
    @interface NSObject ( MyCategory )
      -(void) optionalMethod
      -(void) optionalMethod
    @end


    // instantiate a protocol object
    id obj = @protocol( MyProtocol )


    @protocol P1 { -(void) m1; }
    @protocol P2 { -(void) m2; }
    @interface ConformsToP1AndP2 : NSObject < P1, P2 > {}
    // no need to redeclare m1 and m2, just implement them.


    id obj = ...
    [obj conformsToProtocol:@protocol(MyProtocol)]
    // less code than many respondsToSelector; similar to
    // isKindOfClass.
    // class object also works with comformsToProtocol

    static types on protocols, for type checks
    id <Protocol1> obj1; // static protocol type checks on obj
    MyClass obj2; // static class type checks on obj
    MyClass <Protocol> obj3; // both


    // protocols can be nested.
    @protocol Protocol1 < Protocol2 > { ...

    id <Protocol1 > obj; // obj also conforms to Protocol2; check with conformsToProtocol

    can get tricky

    @protocol BProtocol { ...
    @protocol AProtocol < BProtocol > { ...

    class B : NSObject  < BProtocol > {...
    class A : B < AProtocol >
    class C : NSObject < AProtocol > { ...

    does B need to implement methods in the BProtocol? Yes
    does A need to implement methods in the B protocol? no. it'll inherit
    B's implementation of ten

    does C need to implement methods in the B protocol?
      A includes the B protocol, so any class that adopts
      A must have an implementation for B.
      C implements A.
      C must have an implementation for B.
      C doesn't have one. so, its implementation must implement the B methods.

    note: respondsToProtocol can be met without formally declaring conformance

    // can forward-declare protocols in the event of circular imports


    // "real example": comformance to teh NSCopying protocol
    @interface I : NSObject < NSCopying > {
     // demonstrate con

  4declared properties

    @interface H {
      float value;
      BOOL fake;
    }

    @property (attr, [, attr] ) float value;
    // -(float)value;
    // -(void)setValueg:(float)newValue

    @property (getter=isFake) BOOL fake;


    @synthesize myProp=instanceVarName


    @synthesize accompanies things in the implementation
    readwrite(default), readonly
    assign (simple assignment; acts like you dont own the obj)
      vs retain (as if you're in charge of this object; calls release
        on previous, and calls retain on incoming))

	  is retain like ++referenceCount ?
	  and release like --referenceCount ?
        
      vs copy (deep copy)
        calls copy
        prev value is sent release

      must talk about memory programming
        
    atomic (default and not declared; requests the _internal lock) vs nonatomic (doesn't request locks)

    __weak
    __strong?

    is the instance variable required to exist? will synthesize
    create it? (after all, we declared properties here...)

    is @dynamic required if you implement the get/setter methods anyway?
    why bother? os @dynamic mutually exclusive with @synthesize?
    it appears that @dynamic is the default value for a property.

    you CAN @synthesize, but override, a setter, as in the case
    of storing a mutableArray that will return an immutable as a copy

    must redeclare propertiy attributes in whole EXCEPT readonly and readwrite

    dealloc:
      you can call release on the property, or,
      on a modern runtime, you cannot access the variable
      directly, so you cannot call release. the setter will call
      release on the old variable. so, you can assign
      nil, and depend on the synthesized setter
      to call release for you.

  keychain services:

   osx and ios support the concept of a keychain, where a user
   can store passwords and 'unlock' them all at once. the OS will
   remember all passwords, and apps can access such passwords...
   the iOS will mediate a convesation between the app and the user,
   optionally prompting the user to unlock the keychain if necessary.

   In iOS as opposed to OSX, there is only one keychain, and it is
   never locked.
