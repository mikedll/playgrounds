This is an exploration of common Objective-C and OS X framework
things, to help prepare for programming on iOS.

It runs without having to use the XCode IDE. All you need are make,
and the relevant frameworks and .h files installed...(so XCode
may still have to be installed, or perhaps some OS X installations
have th relevant framework files already installed).
